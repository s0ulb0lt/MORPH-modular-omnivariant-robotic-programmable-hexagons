## 10/9/2025 - Finished research plan iteration 1!  

Today I finished research plan iteration 1 and sent it to an old teacher for review.
It went pretty well, although he was right, I do have a lot of random bulk in the middle of it that I probably could appendice.

Anyways, I will continue making a few edits with my partner, and start routing the PCB as well!
As this is the first journal entry, I'll put an image of one of my earliest mockup sketches from around 2 months ago; takes me back! (Don't worry there's some actual CAD there too)

Here is a mockup of the electromagnet and bobbin we will use to actuate liquid pouches, bending the angles of the hexagon!

(Although I've started this project a while ago, I've set my hours count as low as possible for this journal entry, as it's my first one!)
